# Flash Recap 2x2 DiD

.pull-left[

- 2 groups: Treated and Untreated

- 2 periods: Before and after

]

.pull-right[

Possible comparisons

* Post vs Pre: Time trend problem

* Treatment vs Control: Selection bias problem

]
<br>
<br>
Combine the two to get the DiD

$$ \delta_{2x2}^{DD} = (\bar{y}_T^{post} - \bar{y}_T^{pre}) - (\bar{y}_C^{post} - \bar{y}_C^{pre}) $$
<br>
Crucial Assumption **Parallel Trends**

* Differences between treatment and control are time invariant (don't affect the slope of the time trend).
* Absent treatment the outcome between treatment and control groups would follow the same time trend.

# Regression Version DiD

The typical regression model is

$$Y_{it} = \beta_1 + \beta_2 Treat_i + \beta_3 Post_t + \beta_4 (Treat_i \times Post_t)_{it} + \epsilon_{it}$$
<br>
* Treat: dummy for treatment group.

* Post: post-treatment dummy

* $\beta_1$: pre-treatment mean in control group.

* $\beta_2$: Treatment vs. Control comparison - captures selection bias (assumed to be
time-invariant).

* $\beta_3$: Pre vs. Post comparison, capturing time trend.

* $\beta_4$: is the DD effect, identifying **ATT** (w. homogeneous TE)

# TWFE - DiD with Panel Data

When we observe treated and untreated units for multiple time periods and units potentially experience treatment
at different times the model becomes:

$$Y_{it} = \alpha_i + \alpha_t + \delta_{DD} (Treat_i \times Post_t)_{it} + \epsilon_{it}$$
<br>

* $\alpha_i$: unit fixed effects

* $\alpha_t$: time fixed effects

<br>

* Cluster standard errors at the unit level to allow for serial correlation n (Bertrand, Duflo and
Mullainathan 2004).

<br>

Not sure exactly what $\delta_{DD}$ is and how it compares mean outcomes across units. New 
expanding literature has dived in to this problem.

# The Power of the Pill: Oral Contraceptives and Womenâ€™s Career and Marriage Decisions, Goldin and Katz (2002)

<br>
<br>

.pull-left[

* Early 1970s in the US

* Fraction of women entering graduate professional programs increase

* Women's age at first marriage increases as well

* **Why?**

]

.pull-right[

* Answer by Goldin and Katz:

* the diffusion of the **birth control pill** among the young women in late 1960s.

* They use TWFE to prove that.

# Randomization to the rescue

If randomly assign who gets treated or not (e.g. by flipping a coin) people with high expected gains can not select to get treated.

<br>
<br>

**NB**: The distrib. of $\delta_i$ is still the same in the study pop. $\implies$ there are still people with high and low effects.

<br>
<br>

Missing data problem solved!!

Whether $Y_i^1$ or $Y_i^0$ is observed for each $i$ is random and not a function of any factor that $i$ can act upon.

$$\hat{\delta} = \delta^{ATE}$$
