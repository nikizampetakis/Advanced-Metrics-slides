# Flash Recap 2x2 DiD

.pull-left[

- 2 groups: Treated and Untreated

- 2 periods: Before and after

]

.pull-right[

Possible comparisons

* Post vs Pre: Time trend problem

* Treatment vs Control: Selection bias problem

]
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Combine the two to get the DiD

$$ \delta_{2x2}^{DD} = (\bar{y}_T^{post} - \bar{y}_T^{pre}) - (\bar{y}_C^{post} - \bar{y}_C^{pre}) $$
&lt;br&gt;
Crucial Assumption **Parallel Trends**

* Differences between treatment and control are time invariant (don't affect the slope of the time trend).
* Absent treatment the outcome between treatment and control groups would follow the same time trend.

---

# Regression Version DiD

The typical regression model is

`$$Y_{it} = \beta_1 + \beta_2 Treat_i + \beta_3 Post_t + \beta_4 (Treat_i \times Post_t)_{it} + \epsilon_{it}$$`
&lt;br&gt;
* Treat: dummy for treatment group.

* Post: post-treatment dummy

* `\(\beta_1\)`: pre-treatment mean in control group.

* `\(\beta_2\)`: Treatment vs. Control comparison - captures selection bias (assumed to be
time-invariant).

* `\(\beta_3\)`: Pre vs. Post comparison, capturing time trend.

* `\(\beta_4\)`: is the DD effect, identifying **ATT** (w. homogeneous TE)

---

# TWFE - DiD with Panel Data

When we observe treated and untreated units for multiple time periods and units potentially experience treatment
at different times the model becomes:

`$$Y_{it} = \alpha_i + \alpha_t + \delta_{DD} (Treat_i \times Post_t)_{it} + \epsilon_{it}$$`
&lt;br&gt;

* `\(\alpha_i\)`: unit fixed effects

* `\(\alpha_t\)`: time fixed effects

&lt;br&gt;

* Cluster standard errors at the unit level to allow for serial correlation n (Bertrand, Duflo and
Mullainathan 2004).

&lt;br&gt;

Not sure exactly what `\(\delta_{DD}\)` is and how it compares mean outcomes across units. New 
expanding literature has dived in to this problem.

# The Power of the Pill: Oral Contraceptives and Women’s Career and Marriage Decisions, Goldin and Katz (2002)

# The Power of the Pill Goldin and Katz (2002)

&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

.pull-left[

* Early 1970s in the US

* Fraction of women entering graduate professional programs increase

* Women's age at first marriage increases as well

* **Why?**

]

.pull-right[

* Answer by Goldin and Katz:

* the diffusion of the **birth control pill** among the young women in late 1960s.

* They use TWFE to prove that.

# The Paper

.pull-left[

&lt;br&gt;

* In the paper Goldin and Katz present different ways to support their argument.

* Descriptive evidence a simple theoretical model, and an econometric analysis based on a TWFE DiD.

* We will concentrate on the metrics part of their argument but the paper is of high standard in general.

* They concentrate on post-graduate education (e.g. Medicine, MBA) because it requires extensive up-front education.

## Data

* Various subsets of the US Census data

* They use the US Census population census data from 1970, 1980, 1990.

* They observe measures of:
* Career and marital status outcomes
* Access to the pill
* Abortion when young
* for single year of birth cohorts of college women

]

# The DiD Strategy for Age of the First Marriage

`$$M_{isy} = \alpha_s + \delta_y + \beta X_{isy} + \gamma P_{sy}  + \pi A_{sy} + \epsilon_{isy}$$`
* `\(i\)` indexes individuals; `\(s\)` indexes state of birth; `\(y\)` indexes year of birth.
* `\(M_{isy}\)`: is a dummy variable equal to one if individual i was married before age 23;
* `\(X_{isy}\)`: contains controls for race.
* `\(P_{sy}\)`:  is a dummy variable equal to one if `\(i\)`’s state of birth had a non restrictive birth control law for minors at the time `\(i\)` was 18 years old.
* `\(A_{sy}\)`: is a dummy variable equal to one if abortion was legal in `\(i\)`’s state of birth at the time `\(i\)` was 18 years old.
* `\(\alpha_s\)`: state of birth dummies.
* `\(\delta_y\)`: year of birth dummies.

&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

**Basic idea**: exploit the substantial cross-state variation in the timing of the enactment of impact of state laws regarding birth control access for minors on the likelihood of getting married before age23, for college-educated women born in the United States from 1935 to 1957.

#The DiD strategy for Career and Marital Status Outcomes

&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

* Aggregate cohort analysis based on data from the 1970, 1980 and 1990 U.S. population censuses.


* Unit of observation in the analysis is an age/year cell (or a year of birth /calendar year cell). 20 age
groups (ages30–49) across 3 census years 70, 80 and 90.

&lt;br&gt;


* Actual pill usage `\(\rightarrow\)` proxied by the fraction of college women in a cohort taking the pill before age 21 among those with no births before age 23.


* Pill access `\(\rightarrow\)` proxied by the fraction in a cohort born in a state with a non-restrictive birth control access law when they were younger than 21years

---

#The DiD strategy for Career and Marital Status Outcomes


`$$Y_{at} = \alpha_a + \delta_t + \beta X_{at} + \gamma P_{at}  + \pi A_{at} + \epsilon_{at}$$`
* `\(Y_{at}\)`: the share of age group `\(a\)` experiencing a particular career or marital status outcome in year `\(t\)`;

* `\(X_{at}\)`: contains controls for race.

* `\(P_{at}\)`: measure of access to or usage of birth control for cohort members as young women.

* `\(A_{at}\)`: a measure of access to or usage of abortion for cohort members as young women.

&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

**Basic idea**: to observe successive cohorts at the same age to examine whether between-cohort changes in career and marital status outcomes are related to between-cohort changes in access to the pill and abortion for young single women, controlling for preexisting trends in these outcomes across cohorts.

# Malaria Eradication in the Americas: A Retrospective Analysis of Childhood Exposure, Bleakley (2010)

---

# Bleakley (2010)

.pull-left[

* Malaria persists in tropical regions up to the present day.

* Same areas lower level of development compared to countries in more tempered climates.

* Question naturally arising: Does Malaria hold back economic progress? 
]

.pull-right[

* Computing correlations not enough to answer the question.

* Malaria might depress productivity but the failure to eradicate Malaria might be a symptom of underdevelopment (reverse causality).

* Solution via metrics: exogenous variation to Malaria.

* Setting: two major attempts of Malaria eradication South US (1920) and Brazil, Colombia and Mexico (1950s).

* Malaria has acute symptoms (fever, headache and nausea) and chronic symptoms anemia.

* This paper: long-term effects of childhood exposure to Malaria eradication campaigns on subsequent labor productivity as an adult.

* **Key factor** for the analysis: the eradication **campaigns were exogenous to growth potential** of the affected regions.

]

.pull-right[

* Variation in the Malaria intensity between regions in a given state (southern Mexico - norther Mexico, US south - US north, 
  south Brazil - north Brazil and tierra caliente Colombia).
  
* Areas with high infection rates benefited more from the eradication campaign. 50 to 80 percent decrease after the campaigns.

* Compare outcomes between different age groups at he time of the campaign (Adults - kids).

]

* **Data**: Integrated Public Use Micro Sample (IPUMS)

# Dif-in-Diff Strategy

* Concentrate on males: consistent and higher labor-force participation.

&lt;br&gt;

* Labor productivity measured by: 
average by occupation of all reported labor earnings
weighted average of earnings and education among males within each occupation

&lt;br&gt;

* Combine data to construct panels by cohort and aggregate to year of birth `\(\times\)` census year `\(\times\)` place of birth.


`$$Y_{j,Post} - Y_{j,pre} = \beta M_{j,pre} + X_{j,pre}\Gamma + \alpha + \epsilon_{j,post}$$`
&lt;br&gt;

* Exactly the same as a TWFE with two periods.

# Can Openness Mitigate the Effects of Weather Shocks? Evidence from India’s Famine Era, Burgess and Donaldson (2010)

# Burgess and Donaldson (2010)

.pull-left[
* Rural citizens in **developing countries** today are highly exposures to **weather fluctuations**.

* This exposure can lead to **famines** 
  * Acutely low nominal agricultural income
  * Acutely high food prices.

* Debate whether **trade openness** mitigates or exacerbates the weather socks.
  * Since Adam Smith openness leads to less volatility in real incomes.
  * Mahatma Gandhi and others support that openness increases the frequency of famines.
  

]

.pull-right[

* **Fundamental ambiguity**: income more volatile - consumer prices less volatile
  * What is the net effect on income?

* In the paper concentrate on colonial era (1875 - 1919) India.

* Worst string of famines in history 

* Also the period where the bulk of the railroad network was built.

* **Research Question**: What is the effect of the railroad expansion on the mitigation of the weather shocks on famines?

# Backlash: The Unintended Effects of Language Prohibition in U.S. Schools after World War I, Fouka (2020)

---
# Fouka (2020)

.pull-left[

* Multiple countries strive to **integrate ethnic minorities**.

* Theories of nation building: imposing national language or **repressing minority culture increases homogeneity**.

* Integration policies can lead to a backlash `\(\rightarrow\)` **strengthen the ethnic identity**.

* No empirical evidence whether this is true or not.

]

.pull-right[

* In this paper concentrate on the **prohibition of German in US schools after WWI**.

* How did affect the **first name choice** and the **intermarriage decisions** among the German community in the US?

* How did affect their **patriotism** measured by their voluntary enlistment in the US Army during WWII?

]

---

# The Paper

#### Focus on Indiana and Ohio `\(\rightarrow\)` legislation against the German language.

* Control group all the bordering states (Michigan, Kentucky, Illinois, W.Virginia and Pennsylvania)
  * No banning or English as the mandatory language in public schools.

#### Create index of German name distinctiveness (German Name Index) (0 - 100)
  * How much more frequent a name is among the population of German origin compared with the rest of the population.

#### Intermarriage difficult to measure from the censuses. 
  * In the 40s census only 5% asked their parental birthplaces.
  * In the 30s treatment group to young to be married (14 - 27)/
  * Still unbiased estimates but not representative to the whole population.
  
#### WWII enlistment
  * Match the enlistment data to the census data for volunteers between 1940 - 1942

---

# The Diff-in-Diff Strategy

#### Main strategy is based on comparing cohorts of school age with older cohorts between states with and without a language Law.

`$$Y_{isc} = \alpha + \beta T_{cs} + \lambda_c + \theta_s + \delta \mathbf{Z}_{isc} + \epsilon_{isc}$$`
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

* `\(T_{cs}\)` is an indicator for individuals living in a state with a law and who were within the age range for compulsory schooling (CSL) at the time that law was in place.

* `\(\lambda_c\)` and `\(\theta_s\)`: cohort and state fixed effects

* `\(\mathbf{Z}_{isc}\)`: vector of name properties that affect the probability of a record being matched in a later census
