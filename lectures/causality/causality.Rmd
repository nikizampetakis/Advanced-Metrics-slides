# Causality


What makes Econometrics different from Statistics? 

**Causality**

Statistics $\rightarrow$ statistical inference about large populations via sampling.

Econometrics $\rightarrow$ causal inference via **counterfactuals**.

<br>
<br>

But

* What is causality?

* What do counterfactuals mean?



---

# What does Causality means?


**Why** did something happen?

More precisely: **Does $x$ causes $y$**?

Does $x$ has an **effect** on $y$?

* e.g. Does smoking **cause** lung cancer?


<br>
<br>
<br>

.center[To answer the question what is a **counterfactual** we'll get a bit more rigorous.]

# Potential Outcomes Model (Rubin's Causal Model)


Two states of the world (Potential Outcomes).

 1. Individual $i$ gets the treatment $\rightarrow$ $Y_i^1$.
 
 2. Individual $i$ does **not** get the treatment $\rightarrow$ $Y_i^0$.
 
<br>
 
The observed outcome is

$$ Y_i = D_iY_i^1 + (1 - D_i)Y_i^0 \;\;\; D_i\in\{0,1\} $$
That's a "mathy" way to describe a deep question.

What would have happen to $i$ had they not received the treatment $D_i$?

That's a deep question because we need to **imagine** a parallel universe that the actions taken were different.

Potential outcome $Y_i^0$ is defined as a **counterfactual**.

# Treatment Effect

The treatment effect for $i$ is

$$\delta_i = Y_i^1 - Y_i^0$$



We observe only on of the $Y_i^1$, $Y_i^0$ for every $i$ $\rightarrow$ We can *not* compute $\delta_i$.

This is called

**The Fundamental Identification Problem of Program Evaluation**
