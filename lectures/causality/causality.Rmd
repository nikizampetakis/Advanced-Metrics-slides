# Causality


What makes Econometrics different from Statistics? 

**Causality**

Statistics $\rightarrow$ statistical inference about large populations via sampling.

Econometrics $\rightarrow$ causal inference via **counterfactuals**.

<br>
<br>

But

* What is causality?

* What do counterfactuals mean?



---

# What does causality means?


**Why** did something happen?

More precisely: **Does $x$ causes $y$**?

Does $x$ has an **effect** on $y$?

* e.g. Does smoking **causes** lung cancer?


<br>
<br>
<br>

.center[To answer the question what is a **counterfactual** we'll get a bit more rigorous.]

# Potential Outcomes Model (Rubin's Causal Model)


Two states of the world (Potential Outcomes).

 1. Individual $i$ gets the treatment $\rightarrow$ $Y_i^1$.
 
 2. Individual $i$ does **not** get the treatment $\rightarrow$ $Y_i^0$.
 
<br>
 
The observed outcome is

$$ Y_i = D_iY_i^1 + (1 - D_i)Y_i^0 \;\;\; D_i\in\{0,1\} $$
That's a "mathy" way to describe a deep question.

What would have happen to $i$ had they not received the treatment $D_i$?

That's a deep question because we need to **imagine** a parallel universe that the actions taken were different.

Potential outcome $Y_i^0$ is defined as a **counterfactual**.

# Treatment Effect

The treatment effect for $i$ is

$$\delta_i = Y_i^1 - Y_i^0$$


We observe only on of the $Y_i^1$, $Y_i^0$ for every $i$ $\rightarrow$ We can *not* compute $\delta_i$.

<br>
<br>

This is called

**The Fundamental Identification Problem of Program Evaluation**

<br>
<br>

But are we stuck??

# Question: What about an average effect?

Average Treatment Effect

$$\delta^{ATE} = \mathop{E}\left[ \delta_i \right] = \mathop{E}\left[ Y_i^1 \right] - \mathop{E}\left[ Y_i^0 \right]$$

Fundamentally a **missing data problem**. We observe either $Y_i^1$ or $Y_i^0$.

Set up a naive estimator. Difference of the mean outcome of the Treatment and Control group.

$$\hat{\delta} = \mathop{E}\left[ Y_i^1 | D_i = 1 \right] - \mathop{E}\left[ Y_i^0 | D_i = 0 \right] = \frac{1}{N_T}\sum_{i \in T}^{N_T}T_i - \frac{1}{N_C}\sum_{j\in C}^{N_C}Y_j$$

**Key consideration**: $\delta_i$ is different for different people. To learn about true $\delta^{ATE}$ from $\hat{\delta}$ it matters who gets treated.

If individuals know the gains from treatment $\implies$ $i$s with high gains will select to treatment $\implies$ $\hat{\delta}$ will be upwardly biased from the true $\delta^{ATE}$.

$$\mathop{E}\left[ Y_i^1 | D_i = 1 \right] \neq  \frac{1}{N_T}\sum_{i \in T}^{N_T}T_i$$

---

# Randomization to the rescue

If randomly assign who gets treated or not (e.g. by flipping a coin) people with high expected gains can not select to get treated.

<br>
<br>

**NB**: The distrib. of $\delta_i$ is still the same in the study pop. $\implies$ there are still people with high and low effects.

<br>
<br>

Missing data problem solved!!

Whether $Y_i^1$ or $Y_i^0$ is observed for each $i$ is random and not a function of any factor that $i$ can act upon.

$$\hat{\delta} = \delta^{ATE}$$
